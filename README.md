Obsidian pear is a productivity plugin developed for a straightforward experience, keeping track of all of your needs. Integrated into [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), the Pear Productivity plugin utilizes a flexibly and friendly format which works with all of your notes.

## How to Use
After enabling the plugin in `Community Plugins`, any task created is processed by Pear. This plugin does not remove the basic functionality of obsidian tasks, but rather adds properties in YAML.
```md
- [ ] My task title
  created: !time 2025-02-24 08:00:00
  due: !time 2025-02-25 23:59:59
  priority: 0
  estimate: !dur 00:20:00
  notes: "Hello, YAML!"
```
That's it for now!
